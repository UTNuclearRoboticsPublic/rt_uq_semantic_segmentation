# Project Description

Developing real-time uncertainty quantification for semantic segmentation tasks. The goal is to have a downstream robot, conditioned on well calibrated UQ statistics interact with human operators on joint assembly tasks.

maintainer: slwanna@utexas.edu


# Getting Started

## Prerequistites

This project assumes you have CUDA support 11.6+ and use anaconda for python environment management.

## Installation

1. Clone the github repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/rt_uq_semantic_segmentation
```
2. Recreate the python environment
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
